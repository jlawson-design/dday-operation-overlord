#Project Background
D-Day is an informational/educational website intended to provide accurate historical information of the WW2 Allied amphibious landings known as Operation OVERLORD. The intention is to provide an impartial, elegant, and user friendly recounting of what occured on the beaches of Normandy in June of 1944. 

Inspired by the first project idea from Code Institute, D-Day focuses on providing a useful historical hub with usable evidence-based information. The content is strongly referenced to existing literature, making it a one-stop-shop for information of this well-known historical event. This comes as we pass the 79th anniversary of the operation's commencement on June 6th. 

Like other historical websites such as Britannica or History.com, this site provides a unique user experience, leveraging off the universal principles of design to give an accessible and aesthetically pleasing experience. The target audience for this website is anyone with a cursory knowledge of WW2 history who wishes to learn more. Academics and experts are also welcome, as this site boasts acknowledgements to some of the most famous pieces of secondary sources on the event in question.
