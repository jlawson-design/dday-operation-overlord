# Background
D-Day is an informational/educational website intended to provide accurate historical information of the WW2 Allied amphibious landings known as Operation OVERLORD. The intention is to provide an impartial, elegant, and user friendly recounting of what occured on the beaches of Normandy in June of 1944.

Inspired by the first project idea from Code Institute's brief, D-Day focuses on providing a useful historical hub with usable evidence-based information. The content is strongly linked to existing literature, making it a one-stop-shop for information on this well-known historical event. This comes as we pass the 79th anniversary of the operation's commencement on June 6th 1944.

Like other historical websites such as Britannica or History.com, this site provides a unique user experience, leveraging off the universal principles of design to give an accessible and aesthetically pleasing experience. The target audience for this website is anyone with a cursory knowledge of WW2 history who wishes to learn more. Academics and experts are also welcome, as this site boasts acknowledgements to some of the most famous pieces of secondary sources on the event in question.

# UX
The design of the website should be elegant, minimalist, and ultimately **respectful** to the historical event. An initial design of the website was created through the creation of a wireframe on Figma. 

## User
The user for this site is either someone who has an interest in the subject matter or someone with a deep knowledge of WW2 history. It is unlikely that the user will be some form of organisation and more likely to be an individual. This site caters to both experts and those more unfamiliar to the topic, delivering an accessible experience.
